    "## First Define Database Specs (min, max wavelength, R)\n",
    "\n",
    "Opacities are computed \"line-by-line\" (LBL) grids that are R~1e6 accross a wide wavelength range (e.g. 0.3-300um). In order to make our calculations computationally feasible, we need to create databases that are a resampled subset of this full calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CAUTIONS regarding resampling**: when you resample an opacity database you must resample to **at least 100x higher than your expected data**. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "My data is at R=100...\n",
    "I will need to resample to R=10000\n",
    "\n",
    "My data is at R=3000...\n",
    "I will need to resample to R=300000\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a native line-by-line calculations you don't need to resample. In this case you just make sure that `oldR`=`newR`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The general procedure of the opacity factory is: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Interpolate the given opacity bundle to a common wavelength solution that is comparable R (`oldR` below) to the original LBL calculation\n",
    "2. Resample the opacity accordingly to `newR`. For example, if `oldR`=1e6 and `newR`=1e4, then every 100th point is taken for the final opacity specturm\n",
    "3. Insert that resampled opacity to the databse\n",
