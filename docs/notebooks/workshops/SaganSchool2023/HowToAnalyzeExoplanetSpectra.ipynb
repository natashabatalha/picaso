    "# Basic Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cross Section Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "All rapid radiative transfer codes rely on a database of pre-computed cross sections. Cross sections are computed by using line lists in combination with critical molecular pressure broadening parameters. Both can either be derived from theoretical first principles (e.g., [UCL ExoMol's line lists](https://www.exomol.com/)), measured in a lab, and/or some combination thereof (e.g., [HITRAN/HITEMP line lists](https://hitran.org/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "When cross sections are initially computed, a resolution ($\\lambda/\\Delta \\lambda$) is assumed. Cross sections are computed on a line-by-line nature and therefore usually computed for R~1e6. For JWST we are often interested in large bands (e.g. 1-14 $\\mu$m). Therefore we need creative ways to speed up these runs. You will usually find one of two methods: correlated-k tables and resampled cross sections. [Garland et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03997.pdf) is a good resource on the differences between these two.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demonstration we will use the resampled cross section method. **The major thing to note about using resampled cross sections** is that you have to compute your model at ~100x higher resolution than your data, but then must bin it down to a comparable resolution as your data so you can compare them. You will note that the opacity file you downloaded is resampled at R=10,000. Therefore you will note that **in this tutorial we will always bin the model down to R=100** before comparing with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The overall idea is that we are just simply intializing PICASO to operate, create a \"connection\" to the models/spectral tools, in that wavelength (in microns) with the respective opacity range.**"

    "<i>Why a feature might grow:</i> The strength of a spectral feature is impacted by a molecule's abundance. When we increase atmospheric metallicity, we are increasing the raw abundance of all elements heavier than hydrogen. Complicated chemical processes ensue, resulting in a new distribution of molecules constructed from those raw elements. Some molecules (e.g., CO$_2$) are more sensitive to changes in metallicity than others (e.g., H$_2$O), so although the abundance of all molecules will increase as metallicity increases, they will do so at different rates.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<i>Why a feature might shrink:</i> The strength of all spectral features is tied to the scale height of the atmosphere. Scale height is proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to mean molecular weight ($\\mu$). If the atmosphere is heavier (i.e., bigger M/H, bigger $\\mu$), its scale height will decrease (i.e. it will cling closer to the planet), and consequently all absorption features will decrease in amplitude.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The overall strength of any feature is related both to the molecule's abundance (which is increasing as M/H increases) and the atmosphere's scale height (which is decreasing as M/H increases).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<i>What's going on with CO$_2$ while M/H changes (at low C/O):</i> When C/O was held constant at a low value of 1, and M/H was varied from 1 to 10 to 100, we saw the CO$_2$ feature at 4.4 $\\mu$m increased then decreased. We might infer that it crossed a certain critical M/H threshold, at which point the damping impact of the decreasing scale height overpowered the amplifying impact of the rising abundance.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<i>What's going on with CH$_4$ while M/H changes (at high C/O):</i> When C/O was held constant at a high value of 2.5, and M/H was varied from 1 to 10 to 100, we saw the CH$_4$ feature (embedded within H$_2$O continuum) near 3.35 $\\mu$m shrink smaller and smaller. Our explorations showed that H$_2$O and CH$_4$ both increase in abundance at the same rate when M/H is increased, thus their features <i>relative to one another</i> should not change as M/H changes. However, as M/H increases, so does the mean molecular weight, and thus the scale height shrinks, causing all features to be damped. This damping explains why the CH$_4$ feature and the surrounding H$_2$O background both diminish in tandem as M/H grows.\n",

    "As noted above, we saw different spectral features at low vs. high C/O. We noticed when C/O is low that there is a prominent CO$_2$ feature, whereas when C/O is high we see a prominent CH$_4$ feature. As the C/O ratio increases, there is proportionally more carbon in the atmosphere, facilitating reactions that alter the relative abundance of various carbon-bearing species. One of the most important reactions that takes place is CO$_2$ + H$_2$ $\\rightarrow$ CH$_4$ + H$_2$O. Generally, when C/O increases from $<$ to $>$ 2 x Solar, you go from a carbon dioxide dominated system to one dominated by methane.\n",

For climate calculations we need to make sure that we are covering the full range of the planetary energy distribution, which usually amounts to ~0.3-300 $\\mu$m. This would be prohibitively slow if we used our same monochromatic opacities. Therefore, we instead use correlated-k tables which are on a very low resolution grid with only 196 wavelength points spanning 0.3-300 $\\mu$m. We compute these correlated-K tables **as a function of M/H and C/O**. Therefore, unlike before, we are setting the chemistry of our calculation up front by specifying the correlated-K table.\n"

If atmospheric temperature pressure conditions fall to the left of the red line (lower temp or higher pressure), MgSiO3 will be in its liquid state (condensate).

Planets, specifically puffy planets like WASP-39 b, will reflect a lot of light near the top. As we go deeper, we can see that below 1.4E-3 bars the albedo begins to drop a bit. As the light drops deeper into the atmosphere, it is a lower fractional reflection.
