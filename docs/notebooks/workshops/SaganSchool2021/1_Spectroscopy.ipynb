The rapidly infalling gas accretes through a shock and, in doing so, radiates away a great deal of their gravitational potential energy. The result is an initially cooler, smaller, less luminous planet. This type of formation pathway has been deemed “cold start”. There is likely a continuum of formation pathways between cold and hot start, but here we will just consider two extreme cases."
