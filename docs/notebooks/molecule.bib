 abstract = {The free-free absorption coefficient of the negative ion of hydrogen is calculated within the framework of the R-matrix method. The 1s, 2s and 2p states of hydrogen together with three pseudostates have been employed in the eigenfunction expansion. The results have been found to be in good agreement with other calculations and are believed to be currently the most accurate available.},

 abstract = {Reliable infrared (IR) line lists are reported for the 13 isotopologues of carbon dioxide in HITRAN notation: 626, 636, 628, 627, 828, 727, 827, 638, 637, 737, 838, 738, and 646. Three IR lists are available for each istotopologue: a complete list at 296K, a reduced-size list at 296K, plus a reduced-size list at 1000K. They are denoted Ames-296K, Ames-296K.reduced and Ames-1000K.reduced. With J up to 150, and energy up to 18,000cm−1 above the zero point energy, these lists are expected to cover the temperature range up to 1500K. Line shape parameters including temperature dependence are calculated and reported for four temperature ranges: Mars, Earth, Venus, and Hotter (700–2000K). Comparisons are made against the available transition data in the HITRAN2012 models. Line position accuracy for most transitions up to 10,000–13,000cm−1 is better than 0.03–0.05cm−1. Computed transition intensities agree well with most HITRAN data but there exist suspicious exceptions for isotopologues. These line lists will expedite CO2 IR experimental data analysis and provide the scientific community with trustworthy alternatives for unknown IR bands. These line lists may be combined with existing experimental databases to facilitate the analysis of future laboratory experiments or astronomical observations.},

 abstract = {{A comprehensive hot line list is calculated for 31PH3 in its ground electronic state. This line list, called SAlTY, contains almost 16.8 billion transitions between 7.5 million energy levels and it is suitable for simulating spectra up to temperatures of 1500 K. It covers wavelengths longer than 1 μm and includes all transitions to upper states with energies below hc × 18 000 cm−1 and rotational excitation up to J = 46. The line list is computed by variational solution of the Schrödinger equation for the rotation–vibration motion employing the nuclear-motion program trove. A previously reported ab initio dipole moment surface is used as well as an updated ‘spectroscopic’ potential energy surface, obtained by refining an existing ab initio surface through least-squares fitting to the experimentally derived energies. Detailed comparisons with other available sources of phosphine transitions confirms SAlTY's accuracy and illustrates the incompleteness of previous experimental and theoretical compilations for temperatures above 300 K. Atmospheric models are expected to severely underestimate the abundance of phosphine in disequilibrium environments, and it is predicted that phosphine will be detectable in the upper troposphere of many substellar objects. This list is suitable for modelling atmospheres of many astrophysical environments, namely carbon stars, Y dwarfs, T dwarfs, hot Jupiters and Solar system gas giant planets.

 abstract = {To increase the potential for use of the HITRAN database in astronomy, experimental and theoretical line-broadening coefficients, line shifts and temperature-dependence exponents of molecules of planetary interest broadened by H2, He, and CO2 have been assembled from available peer-reviewed sources. The collected data were used to create semi-empirical models so that every HITRAN line of the studied molecules has corresponding parameters. Since H2 and He are major constituents in the atmospheres of gas giants, and CO2 predominates in atmospheres of some rocky planets with volcanic activity, these spectroscopic data are important for remote sensing studies of planetary atmospheres. In this paper we make the first step in assembling complete sets of these parameters, thereby creating datasets for SO2, NH3, HF, HCl, OCS and C2H2.},
