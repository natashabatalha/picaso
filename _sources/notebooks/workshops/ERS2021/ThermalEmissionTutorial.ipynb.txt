    "## Cross Section Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will continue seeing throughout the ERS training sessions, all rapid radiative transfer codes rely on a database of pre-computed cross sections. Cross sections are computed by using line lists in combination with critical molecular pressure broadening parameters. Both can either be derived from theoretical first principles (e.g. [UCL ExoMol's line lists](https://www.exomol.com/)), measured in a lab, and/or some combination thereof (e.g. [HITRAN/HITEMP line lists](https://hitran.org/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "When cross sections are initially computed, a resolution ($\\lambda/\\Delta \\lambda$) is assumed. Cross sections are computed on a line-by-line nature and therefore usually computed for R~1e6. For JWST we are often interested in large bands (e.g. 1-14 $\\mu$m). Therefore we need creative ways to speed up these runs. You will usually find one of two methods: correlated-k tables, and resampled cross sections. [Garland et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03997.pdf) is a good resource on the differences between these two. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this demonstration we will use the resampled cross section method. **The major thing to note about using resampled cross sections** is that you have to compute your model at ~100x higher resolution that your data. You will note that the opacity file you downloaded is resampled at R=10,000. Therefore you will note that **in this tutorial we will always bin it down to R=100**. "
