# PICASO Retrieval Script Template for fitting a grid model to a spectrum

# CTRL-F "CHANGEME" for areas you should consider changing
# IF CHANGEME is commented out then it is just a suggestion 
# IF CHANGEME is not commented you must change before proceeding 

# Use this as a starting point for create a retrieval script 

# HOW to run with OpenMPI

# Running with mpiexec command line 

# mpiexec -n numprocs python -m mpi4py pyfile
# for example: (-n specifies number of jobs)
# mpiexec -n 5 python -m mpi4py run.py

# ## Step 1) Develop function to get data

def get_data(): 
    """
    Create a function to process your data in any way you see fit.
    Here we are using the ExoTiC-MIRI data 
    https://zenodo.org/records/8360121/files/ExoTiC-MIRI.zip?download=1
    But no need to download it.

    Checklist
    ---------
    - your function returns a spectrum that will be in the same units as your picaso model (e.g. rp/rs^2, erg/s/cm/cm or other) 
    - your function retuns a spectrum that is in ascending order of wavenumber 
    - your function returns a dictionary where the key specifies the instrument name (in the event there are multiple)

    Returns
    -------
    dict: 
        dictionary key: wavenumber (ascneding), flux or transit depth, and error.
        e.g. {'MIRI LRS':[wavenumber, transit depth, transit depth error], 'NIRSpec G395H':[wavenumber, transit depth, transit depth error]}
